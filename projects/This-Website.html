            <h2>Description</h2><br>
            <p>
                As it is a recurring theme for me to create websites for many of my projects, I thought it would only be fitting to finally make
                a website for myself, kind of like a portfolio. I have been putting off this project for many years now for no reason at all, but I am
                glad to finally have a website to show.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                There is really not much else to say, other than I hope that you enjoy reading a little bit about some of my projects. I will be
                updating this website whenever I have new stuff to tell the world, so make sure to check back in a while.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2>Languages used</h2><br>
            <p>
                So I thought it would be a fun challenge to make this website with just vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks are used what so ever.
                The entire website is designed by me, Linus.
