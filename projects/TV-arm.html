            <h2>Description</h2><br>
            <p>
                Due to the small size of my last apartment and the way I had it furnished, I was not able to fit a TV anywhere. So I designed and welded this TV arm.
                It featured a +180Â° hinge which made it possible to watch the TV from either the bed or the couch, as demonstrated in the video above.
                The TV was conveniently stored away when it was not being used and easily swung out for movie nights. Because you have got to have a TV, right?
