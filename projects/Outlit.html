            <h2>Description</h2><br>
            <p>
                Outlit started out as a project for an innovation competition, Blixtlåset, that my class entered in high school. 
                Me and my team of five other people came up with a modular and WiFi controlled power strip. The idea was that you could build however long chains
                of these power strip modules that you needed and then be able to control the outputs with a web application through WiFi.<br><br>

                We presented our concept for the first time at a local sub-competition of Blixtlåset. The jury enjoyed it so much that they sent us
                to the national finals which were held at KTH in Stockholm. During the two weeks that we had before the finals in Stockholm, we managed to build
                a working prototype which we did not have for the first competition. Out of 16 other finalists, and around 250 other competitors, we managed to
                place fourth at the end of the day.<br><br>

                Ambitious as we were, we thought that it would be a good idea to keep working on this project to see how far we could take it. And that is 
                what we did for our high school graduation thesis.<br><br>

                What you see below is the final product of the prototypes that we built. We managed to build the minimum viable product to show off
                our concept, and it worked great. As they were 3D printed and hand-soldered they were not very reliable and we would never leave them unattended.
                Worth mentioning is that we had teachers who were knowledgeable in electrical safety who guided us and checked our work continuously.<br><br>

                But overall it was a great learning experience and a fun project to build.

            <h2>Languages used</h2><br>
            <p>The electronics were based around Arduino boards so the obvious choice of programming language was C++ in the Arduino IDE.</p><br>
