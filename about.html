            <h1>About me</h1><br>
            <p>
                As a person, I am curious and ambitious. I am always interested in new learning opportunities and as a result of this, I have many hobbies. 
                I really enjoy making things, gardening, sporting/exercising, travelling etc.
                I have lots to learn and I am excited for the journey.

            <h2>Academics</h2><br>
            <p>
                As mentioned on the home page, I am a 22 year old engineering student from Sweden. As of the summer of 2022, I completed my bachelor's 
                in <i>Automation and Mechatronics</i> at Chalmers University of Technology. For the upcoming two years I will be attending a master's programme 
                called <i>Systems, Control and Mechatronics</i> which is also at Chalmers. Listed below is all of my higher education:

                        Bachelor's programme. A blend of other programmes such as Mechanical, Data Science and Electonics engineering. The programme gave me 
                        a good foundation of technical knowledge as well as the confidence to work with mechatronics and people of different disciplines.

                    <p>
                        At Plejd, I am employed as a part-time working student, which means that I am able to combine my studies with work whenever I have time for it.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        For my first summer at Plejd (2021) I worked on a testing rig for one of their products. I did everything from planning and designing to manufacturing and assembling.<br>
                        The work included components selection, eCAD (schematics and PCB design), mechanical CAD, hand-soldering (surface-mount and through-hole) 
                        and programming in C. This was a really interesting project and I learnt a lot.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        For my second summer at Plejd (2022) I worked on their open-source project <i>MicroGUI</i>. My job was to implement a way of rendering GUIs created
                        with their web application on embedded displays. My work was purely in software, as I created an Arduino-compatible library (C/C++).
                        I ended up doing more than initially planned and the project turned out great. You should read more about it <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="projects/MicroGUI.html">here</a>!

                        I was employed part-time and worked mostly during holiday/vacation periods. For my first two years at this dairy I worked in production, where
                        I e.g. either managed robot arms that put products in carts or received those carts and pushed them to cooling rooms.
                        For my last two years there, I worked in the same cooling rooms picking orders for clients.

            <p>
                This section is for giving you a brief overview of <b>some</b> relevant engineering skills of mine. <br>Note: Would you believe me if I said that my skills
                are not limited to what you can read below?
            </p><br>

            <h3>Favourite programming languages</h3><br>
            <div style="font-size: 60px">
                <i title="C" class="devicon-c-line colored"></i>

            </div><br>
            <p>
                ( The reason for only highlighting my favourite languages is because the list of languages would otherwise be too long. 
                I frequently use other computer languages than the ones listed above to accomplish tasks such as building websites or creating simulation models. )
